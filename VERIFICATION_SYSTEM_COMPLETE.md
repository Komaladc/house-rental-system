# ✅ VERIFICATION SYSTEM - FULLY OPERATIONAL

## 🎯 **System Status: HEALTHY** ✅

All issues have been successfully resolved and the verification system is now fully functional.

## 🔧 **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Include Path Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: Test files had incorrect include paths causing fatal errors
- **Solution**: Updated paths to match the project structure:
  ```php
  include "lib/Session.php";
  include "lib/Database.php"; 
  include "helpers/Format.php";
  ```

### 2. **Admin Verification Dashboard** ✅
- **Status**: Fully functional at `Admin/verify_users.php`
- **Features**: Shows all pending users, document preview, approve/reject/delete actions
- **Security**: Proper admin-only access control

### 3. **User Registration Flow** ✅
- **Status**: Working correctly 
- **Behavior**: New agents/owners get `userStatus = 0` (require admin approval)
- **Verification**: Proper records created in `tbl_user_verification`

### 4. **Database Integrity** ✅
- **Tables**: All required tables exist and functional
- **Columns**: Correct column names (`reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`, `admin_comments`)
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships working

## 🚀 **Current Workflow**

1. **Registration**: Agent/Owner signs up → Gets `userStatus = 0` (inactive)
2. **Verification Record**: System creates entry with `verification_status = 'pending'`
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Shows all pending users with complete details
4. **Admin Action**: 
   - **Approve**: Sets `userStatus = 1`, `verification_status = 'approved'`
   - **Reject**: Keeps `userStatus = 0`, sets `verification_status = 'rejected'` + reason
   - **Delete**: Removes user completely
