## ✅ OTP Verification Database Integration - FIXED

### 🔍 **Issue Identified and Resolved**

The error "❌ Invalid or expired verification code" was caused by two critical database integration issues:

#### **Problem 1: Null Database Connection**
- **Issue**: EmailOTP and PreRegistrationVerification classes were trying to use a global `$db` variable that was null
- **Error**: `mysqli_real_escape_string(): Argument #1 ($mysql) must be of type mysqli, null given`
- **Root Cause**: The global `$db` variable wasn't being properly initialized when classes were instantiated

#### **Problem 2: Column Name Confusion**  
- **Issue**: Initial analysis suggested database used `otp_code` column, but actual table uses `otp`
- **Error**: `Unknown column 'otp_code' in 'field list'`
- **Root Cause**: Database structure inspection revealed the actual column name is `otp`, not `otp_code`

### 🔧 **Solutions Applied**

#### **Fix 1: Database Connection in Classes**
```php
// BEFORE (causing null reference errors):
public function __construct() {
    global $db;
    $this->db = $db;  // $db was null
}

// AFTER (creates own database instance):
public function __construct() {
    include_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/lib/Database.php';
    $this->db = new Database();  // Creates working connection
}
```

#### **Fix 2: Correct Column Names**
```php
// BEFORE (wrong column name):
INSERT INTO tbl_otp (email, otp_code, purpose, ...)
WHERE otp_code = '$otp'

// AFTER (correct column name):
INSERT INTO tbl_otp (email, otp, purpose, ...)
WHERE otp = '$otp'
```

### 📊 **Database Table Structure Confirmed**
```sql
tbl_otp Table:
- id (int)
- email (varchar)
- otp (varchar)          ← Correct column name
- purpose (varchar)
- is_used (tinyint)
- created_at (timestamp)
- expires_at (datetime)
```

### ✅ **Results After Fix**
